Default Spigot Project Builder
==========

Description
------------
This project offers a default generation for spigot plugin builds.
<br>
This program works with schematics and builds a project folder hierarchy in the output folder.
<br>
It automatically creates it with the needed spigot API dependency and maven groupID/artifactID
<br>
Made with javax.swing (will be changed to javaFX later)
